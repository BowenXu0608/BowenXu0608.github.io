# Homework 3: Style Analysis of Super Mario Odyssey

Super Mario Odyssey is one of the most successful games on Nintendo Switch. Today, I will try to analyze the color style of this game.

Let's see an indoor scene first.

This picture shows the inside scene of the Odyssey. First of all, if we use the color model (HSV) to describe this scene, we can make sure that this game uses various colors in the hue. For example, the guide is yellow, the frog is green, the coconut tree is green, dark blue, and brown, and Cappy is white. Moreover, most colors have high saturation, which means these colors do not turn white, except for the objects that are close to the window, because the outside is hard light. For the aspect of value, we can draw a conclusion easily: the value of this scene is high, but the value difference is not very big; in other words, the dynamic range of this game is narrow. For example, the darkest place in this scene may be the shadow of the chair. Compared it with the brightest place -- the outside of the window, we can see that the brightness difference between them is not very huge. And there are not many details in the dark place, which is the most direct evidence that proves that the dynamic range is narrow. The last important criterion is the model complexity. In this scene, it is clear to observe the smooth curves of the objects, such as the sofa, the frog, and the dinosaur sculpture. As a result, the model complexity is high.

Now we move on to the outdoor scene. We can focus on this picture:

We still use the same method to analyze the color model. In this scene, there are many colors used. The stone is gray, the grass is green, the fountain, bridge, and castle are white, and the Odyssey is red with a yellow balloon. The saturation of this scene is even higher than that of the indoor scene because the sun is nearly off-screen. Most of the objects have a clear color and less gloss. The value of the outdoor scene is still always high; you can't find the shadow, or something is dark. Although the background forest looks like a dark part of this scene, the color of it is close to black, but the value is also high. As a result, the dynamic range of this scene is lower than that of the last picture, making the style more cartoonish. The model complexity is the most interesting part; most objects in this scene have high model complexity, except the stone. You can clearly see that the stone has some faces instead of smooth curves. I think it's the way they highlight the cartoonish style.

In general, we can conclude the style of Super Mario Odyssey: this game uses various colors with high saturation, the value is always high, and the dynamic range is narrow. Most objects have high model complexity, but some specific objects will use low model complexity to manifest the style. All they do is aim to highlight the cartoonish style, which is traditional in the series and attractive for children. However, this style is far from the real world, and this may cause some people to have no sense of substitution.
